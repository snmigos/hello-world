# hello-world
Damn world has never said hello back to me in 25 years.
Right, so the hashtag in here makes it into either a title or a link or both.
(most likely a link which is formatted as a header)
Look at me talking to myself, oh this is fun.
Guess I'll also need to find the linechange secret code.
Also, updated full-stops.
Let's see, what do those other buttons do.
Apologies if I break the internet.
Well, damn.
Apparently I was ahead of my turn in editing this.
In my defense, the guide did state "Next, work towards editing your README and closing this issue."

Captain's log, stardate 15.
Thank loops I had already spotted the "re-open issue" clickything when I closed it.
Write about myself?
Tricky.
Well, I *am* alive.
Also, enveloping in stars makes something blue.
Guess I'll use that preview feature now, to see if I'm about to cause Pluto to change trajectory.
Right, italics it is.
Pro-tip: do not code in Greece.
It's too warm and your brain will become soup sooner.
That should be enough appending; moving on.
