# hello-world
Damn world has never said hello back to me in 25 years.
Right, so the hashtag in here makes it into either a title or a link or both.
(most likely a link which is formatted as a header)
Look at me talking to myself, oh this is fun.
Guess I'll also need to find the linechange secret code.
Also, updated full-stops.
Let's see, what do those other buttons do.
Apologies if I break the internet.
Well, damn.
Apparently I was ahead of my turn in editing this.
In my defense, the guide did state "Next, work towards editing your README and closing this issue."
And it's what I did. -_-
Guess I'll have to reopen it before proceeding.
